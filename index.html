  Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created
   by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's late night programming
    block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of Rick, a cynical
    mad scientist, and his fretful, easily influenced grandson Morty, who split
     their time between domestic family life and interdimensional adventures.
      Roiland voices the series' eponymous characters, with the voice talent of
       Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke providing the rest of
       the family. It premiered on December 2, 2013.
